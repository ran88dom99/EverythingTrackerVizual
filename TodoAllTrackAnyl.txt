TO DO ALL TRACKER HEALTH ANALYTICS PROJECT

#PRIORITY
newest ailments before leaving must consult doctors with 3:07 PM 12/11/2018

zenobase for quant mind or anki or something
see competitors 
data flow chart
every possible event type

#PLANNING
Tracker Journal Report
  after checking all others have made see todonew
  category graphs (already done?)
  Single event type page; 
    NAME 
	DESCRIPTION
	Single graph like in category graphs
	  with lower levels of heirarchy colorcoding
      also in full and 20 days 
	Notes Timeline under each main graph so every mentioned note is visible
	  along side with notes attached reading left to right
	or just table
	Then possible causeffects
	  include probability and overlap graphs
	  Again notes if both items included
	  also strongly effected and co-ocurred
	across category comparison

 
    
Github has many resources on many things. Start there.
 
try out my competitors 12:39 PM 1/14/2019 
 zenobase is nice... idk
 datasense 
 openhuman must be at least a beginner/1course programmer and statistician but I can contribute directly
 exist.io
 
#SOCIAL AND MEDCINE
 at least journals to report 12:51 AM 1/29/2019
  such projects on openhumans and github repository of analysis
  lets add a few aggregation and analysis apps to github and alt.to
  does mysymptoms make a pretty journal report? 
  again; competitors. do other journaling tracking apps make nice reports?

read through sites dedicated to my QS issues 1:02 PM 2/22/2019

who does not want this? anyone who needs to manage symptoms, habits, daily jostling 1:46 PM 2/26/2019
 anyone who wants to be smarter or stronger 1:48 PM 2/26/2019
 
#MYSYM AND OTHER MANUAL RECORDING APPS 
  ask mysym to not destroy symptom records after a symptom has been removed or make a folder to drop these files in and then combine them later? 
 
medecine book self testing 3:19 PM 2/16/2019
for example pain, sleep and distraction; I can only detect its severity when nearly meditating
now add eyesight tests 
suggested by good QS sites
you mean quantified self? well yes but QS focuses more on the go devices
any physical tests?
 
An android journal app; See if i can find something better than mysymptoms.
see "android journal app.txt"
  
# AUTOMATIC GADGET SOURCES 
 accelerometer recoreder for rocking. see my comments in "digital biomarkers" on reddit
 
 get data from googlefit and miwatch2 and weather 3:05 PM 12/11/2018
 
  data sources; weather, quant mind, 3 wearables
 	  
  get miband data out  
  
# COG TEST METHODS SITES
dexterity testing method 6:38 PM 1/7/2019

any games with coaches and really close statistics recording?
or should I just glue together python 

midquant parser converter.  maybe loading through one of the aggregators would be better  5:00 PM 12/19/2018

#PARSERS
keep in mind the aggregators in planning
 
 reftractor formal cogtest  because it is slow and terrible
 
 designate decimals using commas
 
 debug 
 
 mutiunit test

 before cleanup must determine structure and heirarchy
 cleanup diet journal file.
   cleanup old data.
   
#ANALYSIS MULTIVARIATE
cause effect simple samplers 10:12 PM 12/12/2018

PLATFORM FOR RARE EVENTS DETECTION AND TIME CORRELATION ETC POSSIBLY AI WORK
 IF NO COMPETITOR HAS SIMILAR ALGORITHM
 rare events, time  series, causeation analysis, time analysis,
 multi-armedbandit-fuzzy-problem, 
 many-expiraments-at-once, false-discovery-rates.
 games with coaches? and statistics to recommend this or that
 look at stats to remember; already contains an anti-trending lead


 analyse the mnemosyne dataset? that is memeory dataset
 its one of the memorization softwares
 psychometrics, apced repetition, anki, supermemo
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropsychological_test
 
 Get the book "Practical Experiment Designs for Engineers an Scientists" by William J. Diamond. In your initiating post, you mention 8 variables you want to test, each with a high/low value (e.g. on/off, yes/no, etc.) If you're only interested in main effects (i.e. you have reason to assume interactions between your variables are not significant), you can use a resolution III design. The book is basically a recipe book: you have your sigma (standard deviation) because you've done ANKI test duplicates before, use alpha=beta=0.1 and delta=2.5*sigma to get your sample size (N-high=N-low). Then follow the recipe to lay out, perform then analyze the results. These values for alpha (manufacturer's risk; you say something is different when it's not), beta (consumer's risk; you say there is no difference when there is) and delta (difference you want to detect) are good starting points for an initial round of experimentation.

You should do residuals analysis before reaching conclusions to ensure there isn't a time effect. If there is a time effect (sequential repeats improve the response) you'll need to account for that in follow-up experiments.

The book has a computer program you can run. Alternatively, the recipe is so easy to follow you can do it with some columns on a piece of paper with a pencil.

If you're going to do 60 days of work, you might as well be able to say something with a quantifiable amount of confidence. If you're going to do a multivariate test, use a multivariate experimental design.

Everythin about test interactions: learn alot more about time series analysis esp tools in taskview 10:04 PM 12/12/2018
just correlation matrix using only real?? data and including least interesting in 20 bound 10:08 PM 12/12/2018
What about efa pca on missing data 10:06 PM 12/12/2018

 how about n=1 evidence based medecine
 
analogous problems include stock prediction based on other stocks? gysers and seizures and really time series 

type of possible interaction 
#1 short window short incubation already repeated multiple times
	many waves not one or single spline
 	backup from similar effects 
	 or at least checked that they could not have been measured
 same as above but not yet done and interesting
#2 co-ocurred symptoms; they are actually caused by the same thing
see nechacke headche and spine ache and dizziness all have same peak and similarends 
 
 
#UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS ESPECIALY TESTS
 just on one test var by time
  rolling center 
  rolling spread
  rolling extremes
  cycle/periodicity/mcmc?
  prediction from previous
  prediction not given info before this time period in any sense
  learning curves
  deltas
  
 all tests must be taken at various intervals to determine expected variance within time
 filter is what ever rule helps predict both next it and others! that is make many P frame columns
  
 extract learnin curve? define learning curve
 What window or function is best for determining upcoming datapoint? longest that predicts almost as well as best.
 
  cog test learning curve removal. Learning curve is smallest isotonic window 
 cog test scores analysis ; rolling window graph, reall correlation then path analysis. EFA PCA!
 correlation path analysis
  
 better rolling mean(for non symetric time series) 
 
 
  
  
#META FACTORS
 quantity of tests taken in a day is some measure of productivity; one full set takes 40 minutes
 
#GRAPHS PLOTS
 what do the 40'ths bars mean to any given user. Add a concept called big and little events to earmark the appropriate moments in the lines and combines graphs plots. 
 see anchor dates
 
 remove or modify left hand side axises
 
 manualy set order of items

 
#OTHER
 look up independance analysis and consider the corrplot of not cores but dependence in all analyser
 
#DONE
 analysis must include severity scores? for symptoms and maybe duration? 3:07 PM 12/11/2018 9:12 PM 3/27/2019
 
 report on each individual outcome variable needs notes printed that is cat and first level and degree removed 9:18 PM 3/27/2019
 
  remove duration degree and firstlevel/categ for notes 9:34 PM 3/27/2019
  
 check for separate notes mentioning the event type 9:34 PM 3/27/2019

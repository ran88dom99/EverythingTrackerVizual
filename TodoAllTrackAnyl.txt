#TO DO ALL TRACKER HEALTH ANALYTICS PROJECT
Tracker Journal Report
  after checking all others have made see todonew
  category graphs (already done?)
  Single event type page;
    One of the eda packages does this automaticaly
    NAME 
	DESCRIPTION
	Single graph like in category graphs
	  with lower levels of heirarchy colorcoding
      also in full and 20 days
	  color used to indicate height
	Notes Timeline under each main graph so every mentioned note is visible
	  along side with notes attached reading left to right
	or just table
	Then possible causeffects
	  include probability and overlap graphs
	  Again notes if both items included
	  also strongly effected and co-ocurred
	across category comparison
	  
  get miband data out then 
try out the competitors/coworkers 
 
 at mySym and convergence
# energy from this 
# reordering time and degree
# notes jump off and include long list of stuff they may belong to  
  
  ask mysym to not destroy symptom records after a symptom has been removed or make a folder to drop these files in and then combine them later? 
  
Github has many of these resources. Start there.
PLATFORM FOR RARE EVENTS DETECTION AND TIME CORRELATION ETC POSSIBLY AI WORK
 IF NO COMPETITOR HAS SIMILAR ALGORITHM
 rare events, time  series, causeation analysis, time analysis,
 multi-armedbandit-fuzzy-problem, 
 many-expiraments-at-once, false-discovery-rates.
 games with coaches? and statistics to recommend this or that
 look at stats to remember; already contains an anti-trending lead
 
try out my competitors 12:39 PM 1/14/2019 
 zenobase is nice... idk
 datasense 
 openhuman must be at least a beginner/1course programmer and statistician but I can contribute directly
 exist.io

 analyse the mnemosyne dataset? that is memeory dataset
 its one of the memorization softwares
 psychometrics, apced repetition, anki, supermemo

 Get the book "Practical Experiment Designs for Engineers an Scientists" by William J. Diamond. In your initiating post, you mention 8 variables you want to test, each with a high/low value (e.g. on/off, yes/no, etc.) If you're only interested in main effects (i.e. you have reason to assume interactions between your variables are not significant), you can use a resolution III design. The book is basically a recipe book: you have your sigma (standard deviation) because you've done ANKI test duplicates before, use alpha=beta=0.1 and delta=2.5*sigma to get your sample size (N-high=N-low). Then follow the recipe to lay out, perform then analyze the results. These values for alpha (manufacturer's risk; you say something is different when it's not), beta (consumer's risk; you say there is no difference when there is) and delta (difference you want to detect) are good starting points for an initial round of experimentation.

You should do residuals analysis before reaching conclusions to ensure there isn't a time effect. If there is a time effect (sequential repeats improve the response) you'll need to account for that in follow-up experiments.

The book has a computer program you can run. Alternatively, the recipe is so easy to follow you can do it with some columns on a piece of paper with a pencil.

If you're going to do 60 days of work, you might as well be able to say something with a quantifiable amount of confidence. If you're going to do a multivariate test, use a multivariate experimental design.
 
 
 
 filter is what ever rule helps predict both next it and others! that is make many P frame columns
 
 
 accelerometer recoreder for rocking. see my comments in "digital biomarkers" on reddit
 
any games with coaches and really close statistics recording?
or should I just glue together python 
 
 
An android journal app; See if i can find something better than mysymptoms.
 
 report on each individual outcome variable needs notes printed that is cat and first level and degree removed
 
 remove duration degree and firstlevel/categ for notes
  
 check for separate notes mentioning the event type
 
 rewrite parts of txt file not up to standard

 designate decimals using commas
 
 
 just on one var by time
  rolling center 
  rolling spread
  rolling extremes
  cycle/periodicity/mcmc?
  
 extract learnin curve? define learning curve
 What window or function is best for determining upcoming datapoint? longest that predicts almost as well as best.
 
 short window short incubation already repeated multiple times
	many waves not one or single spline
 	backup from similar effects 
	 or at least checked that they could not have been measured
 same as above but not yet done and interesting

 
 
 state act graphs. MANY
 before cleanup must determine structure and heirarchy
 cleanup diet journal file.
 state act effects.
 cog test learning curve removal. Learning curve is smallest isotonic window 
 cog test scores analysis ; rolling window graph, reall correlation then path analysis. EFA PCA!
 data sources; weather, quant mind, 3 wearables
 
 quantify then quantity graphs and cleanup old data.

lots of cleanup and updating 9:37 PM 12/26/2018 

Everythin about test interactions: learn alot more about time series analysis esp tools in taskview 10:04 PM 12/12/2018
just correlation matrix using only real?? data and including least interesting in 20 bound 10:08 PM 12/12/2018
What about efa pca on missing data 10:06 PM 12/12/2018


newest ailments before leaving must consult doctors with 3:07 PM 12/11/2018
 get data from googlefit and miwatch2 and weather 3:05 PM 12/11/2018
 analysis must include severity scores? for symptoms and maybe duration? 3:07 PM 12/11/2018

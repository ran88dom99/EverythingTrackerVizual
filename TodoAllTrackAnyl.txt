#TO DO ALL TRACKER HEALTH ANALYTICS PROJECT

  get miband data out then 
try out the competitors/coworkers 
   
Github has many of these resources. Start there.
PLATFORM FOR RARE EVENTS DETECTION AND TIME CORRELATION ETC POSSIBLY AI WORK
 IF NO COMPETITOR HAS SIMILAR ALGORITHM
 rare events, time  series, causeation analysis, time analysis,
 multi-armedbandit-fuzzy-problem, 
 many-expiraments-at-once, false-discovery-rates.
 games with coaches? and statistics to recommend this or that
 look at stats to remember; already contains an anti-trending lead
 
try out my competitors 12:39 PM 1/14/2019 
 zenobase is nice... idk
 datasense 
 openhuman must be at least a beginner/1course programmer and statistician but I can contribute directly
 exist.io

An android journal app; See if i can find something better than mysymptoms.
 
 report on each individual outcome variable needs notes printed that is cat and first level and degree removed
 
 remove duration degree and firstlevel/categ for notes
  
 check for separate notes mentioning the event type
 
 rewrite parts of txt file not up to standard

 designate decimals using commas
 
 
 just on one var by time
  rolling center 
  rolling spread
  rolling extremes
  cycle/periodicity/mcmc?
  
 extract learnin curve? define learning curve
 What window or function is best for determining upcoming datapoint? longest that predicts almost as well as best.
 
 short window short incubation already repeated multiple times
	many waves not one or single spline
 	backup from similar effects 
	 or at least checked that they could not have been measured
 same as above but not yet done and interesting

 
 
 state act graphs. MANY
 before cleanup must determine structure and heirarchy
 cleanup diet journal file.
 state act effects.
 cog test learning curve removal. Learning curve is smallest isotonic window 
 cog test scores analysis ; rolling window graph, reall correlation then path analysis. EFA PCA!
 data sources; weather, quant mind, 3 wearables
 
 quantify then quantity graphs and cleanup old data. 
 
  
dexterity testing method 6:38 PM 1/7/2019
  
midquant parser converter. 5:00 PM 12/19/2018

cause effect simple samplers 10:12 PM 12/12/2018

lots of cleanup and updating 9:37 PM 12/26/2018 

Everythin about test interactions: learn alot more about time series analysis esp tools in taskview 10:04 PM 12/12/2018
just correlation matrix using only real?? data and including least interesting in 20 bound 10:08 PM 12/12/2018
What about efa pca on missing data 10:06 PM 12/12/2018


newest ailments before leaving must consult doctors with 3:07 PM 12/11/2018
 get data from googlefit and miwatch2 and weather 3:05 PM 12/11/2018
 analysis must include severity scores? for symptoms and maybe duration? 3:07 PM 12/11/2018
